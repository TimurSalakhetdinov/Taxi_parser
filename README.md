# Car Information Fetcher

## Overview
This project automates the process of generating car registration numbers, fetching detailed information for each number via an API, formatting the data for database insertion, and managing API rate limits with randomized delays. It's designed to handle patterns like 'У289ВВ77', fetching car information and processing it for storage or further analysis.

## Features
- Dynamically generates car registration numbers based on predefined patterns.
- Fetches car information using an external API and processes the data.
- Formats the data for easy insertion into a database or for further analysis.
- Implements randomized delays between API calls to adhere to API rate limits and avoid overloading the server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended): To avoid any conflicts with existing Python packages, set up a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install Dependencies: Install all required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the main script from the command line:
```
python main.py
```

This will start the process of generating car numbers, fetching their information, and outputting formatted data. You can adjust the script to insert this data into a database or use it for other purposes.

## Configuration

* Car Number Generation: Customize the generate_car_numbers function in generate_car_numbers.py to alter the generation patterns or the volume of car numbers.
* API Integration: Adapt the get_car_info function in get_car_info.py for specific API requirements or to handle different endpoints.
* Data Formatting: Modify format_for_database in format_for_database.py if you need to change the structure of the formatted data for database insertion or further processing.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several external libraries:

* requests: For making HTTP requests to the API.

Ensure all dependencies are installed using the requirements.txt file.

## Compliance and Rate Limiting

Be mindful of the API's terms of service, especially concerning rate limits and acceptable use. The project includes basic rate limiting functionality, but this should be adjusted according to the specific API's policies.
